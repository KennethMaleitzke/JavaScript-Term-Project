Game 1 Instructions:

Version 1.0
There are currently no problems with the game other than the long loading time!

For a future update to this game I plan to release an update that adds more objects and dogs
to the game to keep the game interesting.

Version 2.0
Added a background image for interesting image results!



Game 2: Move the spy around using the controls at the bottom of the game to avoid
getting hit by the lasers

Version 1.0
There is a couple problems I encountered during the making of this game.
One of these problems was adding an image in place of the cube.

I plan to relese an update to this game in the future by adding images to the game
such as replace the cube with a spy and add a background that moves with the game itself.

Version 2.0
Added an image in place of the cube
Added a background image

Things for future release
Bind movement to WASD keys or arrow keys 



Game 3: Drag and Drop Cats Version
Drag and drop the items / objects to play with the cats!
Left click the objects and move them where ever you want on 
the screen by dragging them.

Current trouble finding good images to add to the game.

Future Updates

I plan on adding better images that look more realistic
but for now I have used clipart images.
