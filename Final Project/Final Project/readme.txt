Game 1 Instructions:
Drag and drop the items / objects to make the dogs happy
left click the objects to move them into the spot you want to.

There are currently no problems with the game other than the long loading time!

For a future update to this game I plan to release an update that adds more objects and dogs
to the game to keep the game interesting.

Game 2: Move the spy around using the controls at the bottom of the game to avoid
getting hit by the lasers

There is a couple problems I encountered during the making of this game.
One of these problems was adding an image in place of the cube.

I plan to relese an update to this game in the future by adding images to the game
such as replace the cube with a spy and add a background that moves with the game itself.

Game 3: To be announced
